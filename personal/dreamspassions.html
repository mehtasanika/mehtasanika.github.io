			<h1>What Are Your Dreams/Passions?</h1>

			<div class="question1">
				<h2>What are some characteristics of your ideal workplace?</h2>
				<p> I want a small, comfortable, friendly environment where my colleagues and I work together and feed off each other. I want them to have a good work ethic, be accepting, creative, different than me so I learn new things from them. I don't want my workplace to be a dull or very intense atmosphere where people talk behind each other's backs. I want it to be a well-managed firm that organizes their time well and gives work on time. I definitely want the workplace to be in New York, so it is close to home and hopefully I will be able to stay in the city. My workplace should be an established place where there are at least thirty workers but no more than an hundred because I want to know everybody.</p>

			<div class="question3">
				<h2>What kind of work do you want to be doing?</h2>
				<p>I want to work at a digital agency and work with different companies and people in order to understand how different people work and how their needs can be different and how to tackle that. Also, by working with different companies, I will be able to understand how to brand a company and a create an image for them. I want to be a part of that process from start to finish. Meeting the client, learning about the company/background, what their goals are, and what they want their image, logo, social media or website to say to their customers.

			<div class="question4">
				<h2>What are you passionate about?</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Branding, Advertising- how a company creates an image for a brand or product</li>
					<li>Fitness- I really believe in a healthy body and going to the gym and following trainers for the best types of exercises for different body parts</li>
					<li>Art/Design- I really love how art/design has impacted the world and changed people’s perspective. I really like visually communicating messages instead of reading information or statistics</li>
					<li>Helping others and bringing change to the idea of design- many people outside this industry think design education has no careers, but I think they are completely wrong, those of the kinds of people you need the most in world because people need an image of a brand/company to be attractive to them</li>
					<li>Fashion Apparel-looking into the different trends that come about, following fashion weeks and famous designers of what they are upto and what kind of work they are trying to create, use their work as inspiration for mine</li>
				</ul>
