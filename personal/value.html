					<p><h2>Family/Friends</h2></p>
					<p><h3>My family has been my biggest support system through thick and thin. They have guided me throughout all my decisions and helped me be the person that I am today. My parents have instilled the most priceless values in me that I use and am grateful for everyday. My family has taught me communication, perseverance, resposbility, and respect.
					My friends are also a huge part of who I am today because they have influenced me to be myself and to never think of friendships in quanity, but in quality. I have an extremely limited friend group, but those are the friends that I have learned the most from. They have taught me respect, trust, support, and gratitude.</h3></p>

					<p><h2>Food/Shelter</h2></p>
					<p><h3>Being appreciative of food and shelter is very important in this day and age because I feel like it can be easily overlooked for the privileges I have. I am very grateful for my parents for being able to provide food and shelter for me. Being in college has really made me appreciate home food, being able to go out to fancy restaurants and normal fast-food places. I'm also extremely grateful for being able to live in New York City and at a location that shows me wealth and poverty.</h3></p>

					<p><h2>Education</h2></p>
					<p><h3>Having the opportunity to be able to go to one of the best schools in the country was not appreicated until I came to college and saw what other people went through to get to where they are now. I am so grateful that I was able to get one on one attention and guidance with my teachers and guidance counselors. Also, with the help of teachers, I was able to choose design school as a option to go to college. My art teacher guided me through my portfolio and applications and that is how I am at Parsons School of Design. Choosing to come to Parsons has been one of my best decisions because the opportunites, facilities, and education it has given me so far, I don't think I would have been able to get anywhere else. Parsons has helped me understand what is design and how to take it on.</h3></p>
