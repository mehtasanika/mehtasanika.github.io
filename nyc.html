  <center><p> Ever since I was in New York, it was my dream to live in New York City and fortunely I am living that dream right now by going to college here. When I was making my college decision, I was very eager not to stay in NYC because I thought it would be too close to home and I didn't know if art/design school was the right fit for me, but the thing that I realized was that whatever opportunities I get here, in this city and college, I would never get anywhere else. I always thought of living in the city once I had a job, but studying design was a whole other jump in my books. I ended up choosing Parsons School of Design because I believed it was the only college that would allow me to pursue all my passions in the best city of the world. I think NYC is the perfect environment to study design in because they are many different types of industries in which design can be explore in and endless possibilities.</p></center>
