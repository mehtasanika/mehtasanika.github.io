  <p>Zara is my favorite place to shop, but I can never shop on their website because I think they have the most unorganized and confusing website for an online shopper. Their text is in all different sizes and places, so I get confused of what they are trying to point out or give importance to or which tab to go into. Their page sizing is horrible because it is not set to change if the window page size changes, so if the page size is different on your screen than what they set it to then the text overlaps making it very hard for the viewer to read the tabs and information they are trying to read. Also, the images used to show the clothing have great detail and quality, but I don't think they should be so big in ever part of the website. I agree that you keep the home page image the size of the page, but the shopping section where they are showing the product, all the images should be the same size and in a specific layout, so it is easier for the viewer to go through their collection. When the images are all different sizes and very look book type, one can't tell which product they are trying to show.</p>
