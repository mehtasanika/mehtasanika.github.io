  <p>I really liked this website because it was very organized compared to the recent websites I have visited. Usually there is so much going on the home page of a website, that your face feels thrown with bunch of information as soon as you open a page. However, with the SwearBy website, I found it very easy and simple to navigate and read through the information. They had a lot of information on their scroll homepage, but it was set in a very organzied and structured way that your eyes moved with page. I also love the typographic choices the company made because all the text is readable and consistent. There are also many interactive elements in the website, which make each page engaging in their own way. Another thing, I really liked about the website was how the company incorporated the products that they supported in a grid-like format that goes with the aesthetic of the website. They didn't just place them anywhere. The company tried to keep this website as simple as possible for any type of viewers to use and understand. </p>
