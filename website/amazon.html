  <p>Amazon is a website that I use very often and I think it is one of the easiest shopping websites to navigate even though it has so much information on it. As soon as you open the website, your page is filled with different sized and colored images, text, and ads. However, through that chaos, I still find it really easy to find the different features within the website like your cart, help page, prime, movies, etc. I think the only thing that I don't like about this website or is not that easy to find are the mini tabs underneath the search bar. I think those should be bolded too like the ones next to them, because they are important tabs for a customers to visit. Since there are so many images and text surrounding that part, the tabs get hidden. Other than that I think the reviews section needs to be improved too. They need to organize the likes and dislikes of the products better, so it is easy for a customer to find and read which review is positive and negative.</p>
