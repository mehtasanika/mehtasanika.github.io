  <p>Covette Clinic is a website that I came across while working and when I landed on their homepage, I loved their aesthetic and typographic choices. The homepage is nicely designed, but I think it is loaded with information that is a little hard to read. I liked how they put the tabs on the two sides of the page, but I wished there were less tabs or they combined some of them. I think a lot of their information is also repeated or unecessary for the website. For example, I don't think it is necessary to have both media and gallery or a membership tab if it doesn't do anything once you go to the page. The website is trying to convey the company's message visually and typograhpically, which I think gets too complicating. Also, I don't like how I don't have control over the carousel and I have to wait until it switches to the next slide. I also don't like how the typography is not consistent. They have five to six different fonts going on throughout the whole website, which is very confusing as a viewer because you don't know what they are trying to give importance to. However, the animations and overall design of the website is very clean, elegant, and thoughtfully planned out.</p>
