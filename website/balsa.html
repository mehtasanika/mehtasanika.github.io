  <p>Balsa NYC is a fashion startup that deals with ready-to-wear clothing in a luxury sense. They recently relaunched their website and there are some parts that are really nice and others that just don't work, represent the brand or look good on the website. For example, when I first opened the page, the tabs were overlapping each other and home page images looked weird. Also, when it opened to the home page, I was surprised to see the "exit" sign image as the first image to describe a clothing. Usually for a clothing website, there is an interesting chain of photos of models wearing their clothing or the brand logo. I didn't like the "exit" sign as the first image, as a viewer I did not what that means and how it relates to the brand. However, the next two graphic elements are really nice, which are the rubik's cube and the two photos side-by-side and tell me a little about the brand. I love how they did their shop and sets section because it came out to be so clear and simple then the homepage that it gives you a clearer image about the brand. I love how the model photos move a different angle when you hover over it. Also, the text is so easy to read and not too big to distract you from the clothing. Another part, I really like from this website is their set section, which puts together a whole outfit and allows you to buy the whole set as a purchase or gives you an idea how to dress the item of clothing. I love how they used minimal design in these pages, but I wished they had more things going on in the home page because it feels very empty and tells me nothing about the brand really.</p>
