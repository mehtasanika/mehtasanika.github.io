  <p>I was born in Flushing, Queens in 1998. I lived here until I was five years old. I don't remember that many memories here because I was very small, but whatever I do remember are extremely special to me. I went to preschool and kindergarten here and made a lot of friends that I am still in touch with today. The fondest memory I have living in Queens was living in an apartment surrounded by close family and friends. At that time, I would meet my friends everyday because I would go to school with them and then play in the park with them in the evening. My parents decided finally decided to move from Queens to Westchester when I was five years old and my brother was nine because of educational purposes.</p>
