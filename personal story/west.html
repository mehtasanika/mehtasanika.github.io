  <center><p> Moving to Westchester was a huge change for me because I was very small and it was the first time I was going to an area where I didn't know anybody expect my family. I didn't know how to make friends nor did I know if anynody would like me here. The only thing I was excited about was having my own room. My family moved here because my parents believed we would get better education here, which at the end was true, but the struggle of adapting to a new environment was very difficult in the beginning. My brother and I were the only Indians in the school, which was kind of intimidating. As the years went by, I did gain a great group of friends, education, and some of the best experiences of my life.</p></center>
